# single-visit-occupancy
R code to fit single-visit occupancy models on Common Dolphin data from PELGAS surveys (Bay of Biscay).
This analysis uses the hSDM library.
Data on common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) were collected between 2012 and 2014 during the PELGAS spring surveys.
There are three R scripts for reproducing the analysis, and a datafile.
